# -regularized-logistic-regression-to-predict-whether-microchips-from-a-fabrication-plant-passes-QA
In this part of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression
to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure
it is functioning correctly.
Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the
test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests,
you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or
rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results
on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.
